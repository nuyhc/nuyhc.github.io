# [DSP] Section 1
[[REF | AudioSignalProcessingForML]](https://github.com/musikalkemist/AudioSignalProcessingForML)
## 1. Overview
- 이미지 딥러닝에 대한 정보는 많지만, 오디오 관련된 정보는 적은 편임

### Main Q?
- 해당 기술(audio processing)을 어디에 적용할 수 있는가?
  1. Audio classification
  2. Speech Recognition / Speaker Verification
  3. Audio Denoising / Audio Upsampling
  4. Music Information Retrieval
     1. Music Intrument Classification
     2. Mood Classification
     3. ...
  5. ...

### Content
- Sound Waves
- DAC / ADC
- Time-and Frequency-domain audio featues (e.g., rms, spectral centroid, ...)
- Audio Transformaions
  - FT / STFT
  - Constant-Q
  - Mel Spectograms
  - Chromograms
- ...

### What you'll learn
- Get a deep understanding of audio data
- Familiarise with freq./time-domain audio featues
- Extract features from raw audio
- Recognise what audio features to use for ML applications
- Preprocess audio data for ML
- Understand math behind audio transformations
- Use `librosa` for audio projects

## 2. Sound and waveforms

### Sound
- Produced by vibration of an object
- Vibrations cause air molecules to oscillate
- Change in air pressure creates a wave

### Mechanical wave
- Oscillation that travels through space
- Energy travels from one point to another
- The medium is deformed

### Sound Wave
- Atmospheric Pressure
- Compression
- Rarefaction

### Waveform
- 소리의 압력 변화
- 오디오의 특징(features)를 결정하는 중요한 기본
  - Frequency
  - Intensity
  - Timbre

### Periodic and Aperiodic Sound
- All Waveforms
  - Periodic
    - Simple (Single SineWaves)
    - Complex (Multiple SineWaves)
  - Aperiodic
    - Continuous (Noise)
    - Transient (Pulse)

### Frequency and Amplitude
- Freq. -> higer
- Amp. -> louder

### Pitch
- Logarithmic perception
- 2 frequencies are perceived similarly if thet differ by a power of 2
- A4(440Hz) / A5(880Hz)

### Mapping pitch to freq.
$$F(p) = 2^{ {p-69} \over 12 } \times 440$$
$$F(p+1)/F(p) = 2^{1/12} = 1.059$$

### Cents
- 특정한 두 음의 음고(Pitch) 높낮이의 거리를 로그(Logarithm, log) 스케일로 표시하는 단위
- Octave divided in 1200 cents
- 100 cents in a semitone
- Noticeable pitch difference: 10-25 cents

## 3. Intensity, loudness, and timbre (세기와 음색)
### Sound Power
- Rate at which energy is transferred
- Energy per unit of time emitted by a sound source in all directions
- Measured in watt (W)

### Sound Intensity
- Sound power per unit area
- Measurd in $W/m^2$

### Threshold of Hearing
- $TOH = 10^{-12}W/m^2$

### Threshold of Pain
- $TOP = 10W/m^2$

### Intensity level
- Logarithmic scale
- Measured in decibels (dB)
- Ration between two intensity values
- Use an intensity of reference (TOH)

$dB(I) = 10 \log_{10}({I \over I_{TOH} })$
- ~3dBs -> intensity doubles

### Loudness
- Subjective perception of sound intensity
- Depends on duration / frequency of a sound
- Depends on age
- Measured in phons (복잡한 소리에 대한 음량 레벨의 로그 단위)

### Timbre
- Colour of sound
- Diff between two sounds with same intensity, frequency, duration

### What are the features of timbre?
- Timbre is multidimensional
- Sound envelope
- Harmonic content

### Sound envelope
- Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release (ADSR) Model

### Complex sound
- Superposition of sinusoids
- A partial a sinusoid used to describe a sound
- The lowest partial is called fundamental frequnecy
- A harmonic partial is a frequency that's multiple of the fundamental frequency
- Inharmonicity indicates a deviation from a harmonic partial

### Frequency modulation
- AKA vibrato
- Periodic variation in frequency
- In music, used for expressive purposes

### Amplitude modulation
- AKA tremolo
- Periodic variation in amplitude
- In music, used for expressive purposes

### Timbre recap
- Multifactorial sound dimension
- Amplitude envelope
- Distribution of energy across partials
- Signal modulation (frequency/amplitude)

### Sound recap
- Sound is a wave
- Frequency, Intensity, Timbre
- Pitch, Loudness, Timbre
