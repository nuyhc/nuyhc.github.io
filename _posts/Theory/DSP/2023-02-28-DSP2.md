# [DSP] Section 2
[[REF | AudioSignalProcessingForML]](https://github.com/musikalkemist/AudioSignalProcessingForML)
## 4. Understanding Audio Signal
### Audio Signal
- Representation of sound
- Encodes all info we need to reproduce sound

### !!Problem!!
- Analog vs Digital

### Analog Signal
- Continous values for time
- Continous values for amplitude

### Digital Signal
- Sequence of discrete values
- Data points can only take on a finite number of values

### Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC)
- Sampling
- Quantization

### Pulse-code modualation

### Sampling
#### Locating Samples
- $t_n = nT$
#### Sampling Rate
- $s_r = {1 \over T}$

### Nyquist Frequency
- $f_N = {s_r \over 2}$

### Aliasing

### Quantization
- Resolution = num of bits
- Bit depth
- CD resolution = 16 bits

### Memory for 1' of sound
- $((BitDepth \times SR / 1,048,576)/8) \times 60$
- ${ {BitDepth \times SR} \over 1,048,576} \times {1 \over 8} \times 60$

### Dynamic Range
- Difference between largest/smallest signal a system can record

### Signal-to-quantizaion-noise ratio
- Relationship between max signal strength and quantization error
- Correlates with dynamic range
- $SQNR \approx 6.02 \times Q$
- Q: Bit Depth
- $SQNR(16) \approx 96dB$

### How do we record sound?
- Analog signal -> ADC -> Digital signal

### How do we reproduce sound?
- Digital signal -> DAC -> Analog signal

## 5. Types of audio featues for ML
### Why audio features?
- Description of sound
- Different features capture different aspects of sound
- Build intelligent audio systems

### Audio feature categorisation
- Level of abstraction
- Temporal scope
- Music aspect
- Signal domain
- ML approach

#### Level of abstraction
- High-level : intrumentation, key, chords, melody, ...
- Mid-level : pitch-and beat-related descriptors, MFCC, ...
- Low-level : amplitude envelope, energy, spectral centroid, ...

#### Temporal scope
- Instantaneous (~50ms)
- Segment-level (seconds)
- Global

#### Music aspect
- Beat
- Timbre
- Pitch
- Harmony
- ...

#### Signal domain
- Time domain
  - Amplitude envelope
  - RMS energy
  - ...
- Frequency domain (푸리에 변환 이용)
  - Band energy ratio
  - Spectral centroid
  - Spectral flux
  - ...
- Time-frequency representation
  - Spectrogram
  - Mel-spectrogram
  - Constant-Q transform

#### ML approach
- Traditional ML
- DL

##### Traditional ML (다양한 피처들 중 일부를 골라 분류)
- Amplitude envelope
- RMS energy
- Zero crossing rate
- ...

##### DL
- 피처 전체를 넣음

### Types of intelligent audio system
- DSP -> rule-based system
- Tranditional ML -> feature engineering
- DL -> automatic feature extraction

## 6. How to Extract Audio Features?
### Time-domain feature pipeline
- Analog signal -> ADC -> Digital signal -> framing -> feature computation -> aggregation(mean, median, ..) -> feature value/vector/matrix

#### Frames
- Perceivable audio chunk
  - $1 \ sample @ 44.1KHz = 0.0227ms$
  - $Duration \ 1 \ sample << Ear's \ time resolution (10ms)$
- Power of 2 num samples
- Typical values: 256 - 8192
  - $d_f = {1 \over s_r} \times K$
  - d: duration
  - K: frame size

### Frequency-domain feature pipeline
- Analog signal -> ADC -> Digital signal -> framing -> windowing -> FT -> feature computation -> aggregation(mean, median, ..) -> feature value/vector/matrix

#### Spectral leakage
- Processed signal isn't an integer number of periods
- Endpoints are discontinous
- Discontinuities appear as high-frequency components not present in the original signal

#### Windowing
- Apply windowing function to each frame
- Eliminates samples at both ends of a frame
- Generates a periodic signal

##### Hann window
- $w(k) = 0.5 \times (1 - \cos( { {2\pi k} \over K-1 } ) ), k=1...K$
- k: sample rate
- 윈도우 적용:
  - $s_w(k) = s(k) \times w(k), k=1...K$
- 프레임을 이어붙이면 신호가 사라지는 문제가 있음
  - -> Overlapping frames으로 해결 가능
